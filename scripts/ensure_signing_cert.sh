# Subsequent runs detect the existing cert and exit immediately (no-op).
# Does NOT require an Apple Developer account.
#
# Why this matters: macOS TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) keys
# permission grants on the code signature. An ad-hoc signature changes
# every build, so granted permissions (Full Disk Access, Accessibility,
# etc.) reset on each rebuild. A stable self-signed identity preserves
# them across rebuilds.
